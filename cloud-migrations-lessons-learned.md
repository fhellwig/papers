# Cloud Migrations &ndash; Lessons Learned

_Cloud Migration Case Studies from Representative Government Agencies_

**Cloud Migration Working Group**

_ACT-IAC, January 24, 2018_

## Synopsis

This white paper discusses representative case studies from Federal Government agencies and organizations detailing their mission objectives and lessons learned as they moved all or part of their infrastructure and computing needs into hosted and managed cloud service providers.

These case studies cover a broad set of usage models that include Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). They range from data center lift-and-shift endeavors to remote applications and Office 365 migrations.

The case studies in this white paper provide a set of lessons-learned that can be used by Government stakeholders as they plan their cloud migration strategies. These are real-world examples that illustrate in deed and form a topic that is often discussed in abstract terms.

Readers will find information in these case studies that can assist them with cloud migration efforts. This paper provides names and resources that can offer transition guidance and mitigate the risks of cloud adoption.

The choices of vendors and solutions made by represented Government agencies and organizations are based on program-specific selection criteria. The Cloud Migration Working Group respects the independence of these choices and does not itself advocate any one vendor or solution over another.
